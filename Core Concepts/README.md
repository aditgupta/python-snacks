# Core Concepts

## Functions
I've covered the following topics:
 - Higher-order function
 - Inner functions
 - Inner function with *nonlocal* keyword
 - A simple decorator
 - A simple recursion

### Higher-order functions

### Inner functions

A basic example demonstrating the use of nonlocal keyword. Note how the inner function is accessing the parent function's variable.
