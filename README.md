# Python Snacks

Welcome to Python Snacks, a repository of simple and (not-so-simple) Python problems and code examples to illustrate Python concepts. 

## Introduction

Python Snacks is a collection of problems and code examples that cover a wide range of Python topics, from basic syntax and data types to topics like object-oriented programming, data analysis, and web development. Each problem includes a brief description of the problem and one or more examples of how to solve it in Python.

## Getting started

To get started with Python Snacks, simply browse the repository and find a problem that interests you. Each problem is organized into its own folder and includes a README file with a description of the problem and one or more Python files with code examples.

If you find a problem that you're particularly interested in, you can also try solving it yourself before looking at the provided code examples. 

## Problem Categories

I have organised the problems in my repository into three categories based on their difficulty. 
- L1 problems are basic
- L2 problems are intermediate
- L3 problems are advanced. 

Each problem has its own folder, which includes a README file with a code visualisation for the problem.

## Core Concepts

In addition to the problem categories, I have also included a folder named "Core Concepts". This folder contains basic code examples to illustrate Python concepts. These examples are a great starting point for beginners who are just learning Python.

## Contributing
