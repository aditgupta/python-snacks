# Python Snacks

Welcome to Python Snacks, a repository of simple and (not-so-simple) Python problems and code examples to illustrate Python concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository is a great resource for learning and practicing Python.

## Introduction

Python Snacks is a collection of problems and code examples that cover a wide range of Python topics, from basic syntax and data types to topics like object-oriented programming, data analysis, and web development. Each problem includes a brief description of the problem and one or more examples of how to solve it in Python.

The goal of Python Snacks is to provide a fun and interactive way to learn and practice Python, whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer. The problems are designed to be challenging but not overwhelming, so you can work through them at your own pace and build your Python skills over time.

## Getting started

To get started with Python Snacks, simply browse the repository and find a problem that interests you. Each problem is organized into its own folder and includes a README file with a description of the problem and one or more Python files with code examples.

If you find a problem that you're particularly interested in, you can also try solving it yourself before looking at the provided code examples. 

## Problem Categories
I have organised the problems in my repository into three categories based on their difficulty. The L1 problems are basic, the L2 problems are intermediate, and the L3 problems are advanced. Each problem has its own folder, which includes a README file with a code visualisation for the problem.

## Core Concepts
In addition to the problem categories, I have also included a folder named "Core Concepts". This folder contains basic code examples to illustrate Python concepts. These examples are a great starting point for beginners who are just learning Python.
